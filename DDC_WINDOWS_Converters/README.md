Each sub-directory bundles one or more binary executables
(`*.exe`) together with Qt runtime libraries (`Qt6Core.dll`,
`Qt6Gui.dll`, `Qt6Widgets.dll`, etc.) and a local `LICENSE` file
carrying the third-party component attributions that apply to
those specific binaries (Open Design Alliance, Qt, and others).

## How these binaries relate to the MIT-licensed parts of the repo

The repository's MIT-licensed n8n workflows, AI agent
instructions, Python utilities, and samples orchestrate these
binaries via subprocess calls. You may freely study, modify, and
redistribute the MIT-licensed orchestration files; you may NOT
redistribute these binaries without a separate commercial
licence.
